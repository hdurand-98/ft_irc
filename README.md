# ft_irc

Duo project where the aim is to make an irc server that you can connect to, create channels, chat and stuff.

# How to use
Make and execute ./ircserver port password

Where "port" is the port that you want to open and "password" the password to connect to your server. Once the server is started you can use some irc interfaces like irssi to use it, happy time travel to the early 2000's !
